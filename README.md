# Address_Book

Write a program that functions as an address book. It should have entries containing at least the following information: first and last name, phone number, address, and email address. At a minimum you’ll want an address book entry class. You should be able to add entries and search for entries (by last name at a minimum).

In order to save the address book for later you’ll need to write it to a file. Don’t worry about saving the address book to a file if you don’t already know how to do that. Other C# courses on Treehouse teach how to do that.
